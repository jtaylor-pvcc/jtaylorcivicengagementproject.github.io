		<h1>Civic Engagement Topic</h1>
		<p>My Civic Engagement topic is as follows: Is it acceptable to participate in today’s technical society without making an effort to understand the basics of that technology? For instance, do members of a democracy, whose votes often determine how technology will be supported and used, have an obligation to try to understand that technology? Does your answer depend on which technology is being considered? For example, is your answer the same when considering nuclear technology as when considering computer technology?</p>

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>This inquiry contains a multitude of unique facets. It asks the main question: “Should you have to try to understand the technology that surrounds you?” Then it dives into more specific instances. It questions if one’s participation in democracy adds to this obligation or not and if the type of technology being referred to differs the criticality of understanding it. There is much to go into for this topic and I have researched notable sources for opinions along with providing my own bias.</p>

		<h1>Personal Opinion</h1>
		
		<p>I believe that it is not acceptable for one to participate in today’s technical society without making an effort to understand the basics of that technology. I am under the conviction that it is both one’s personal duty and responsibility to challenge themselves enough to grasp the basics of the technology which they interact with on a day-to-day basis. For your own betterment and the betterment of the society around you, making an effort to understand these basics can only do good.</p>
	
		<p>Regarding members of a democracy whose votes have the power to determine how this technology will be supported and used, I believe they are burdened with an even greater obligation to truly understand the basics of this technology. To uphold your democratic right to its proper respect and to utilize it wisely, it is a necessity that one can fully grasp at least the basic subject matter of what they are voting on.</p> 

		<p>Regarding the type of technology considered, I believe that understanding the fundamentals of primary technology is more relevant than trying to understand more niche and specialized areas. However, if the technology possesses an immediate and direct impact upon your life, I believe learning about it is necessary. I am under the notion that gaining knowledge on these other, more unique technologies is less important but learning about any type of technology will never be unfruitful.</p>

		<h1>Other Opinions</h1>
		
		<p>Important government sites agree with these aforementioned notions about the significance of having a basic, fundamental understanding of the technologies that surround us every day. The Bureau of Cyberspace and Digital Policy emphasizes in one of its articles the importance of possessing rudimentary knowledge about technology to defend against the prevalence of digital manipulation and deception.</p>

		<p>Another government department that shares the same sentiments about this topic is the U.S. Department of Education. In a journal article, they stress the importance of teaching technological fundamentals within our education systems to ensure this baseline level of digital competence in our future generations</p>

		<p>In relation to non-government opinions, this similar idea is shared by others in different articles. On the site Getting Smart, Jamie Back, an Upper School STEAM Teacher, writes about the essentialness of understanding technology and possessing computational thinking capabilities. She goes on to clarify how this learned trait is not only necessary for those interested in STEM-related career paths but everyone.</p>
